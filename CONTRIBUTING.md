### PEP-8

All the code must be tested against a Python PEP-8 linter before commiting and pushing to this repository.

Common Python PEP-8 linters are `pyflakes`, `flake8` and `pylint`. They are available for download and will work natively with the vast majority of IDEs out there.

### Commit messages

- You MUST NEVER use punctuation or symbols such as dots or hyphens as commit messages. 
The reasoning behind it is that if a bug should be found, commit messages that are indistinguishable from one another will make it harder to point to the defective commit, track and/or purge it from the tree.
